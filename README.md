### Hi. I'm Karangu Lucas Wairore, nice to meet you. Please take a look around!

I am currently studying **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**, at **Machakos University** located in **Kenya**, which involves computing, mathematics, programming and web development.

Out of all of the modules I am studying I most enjoy web development, as I really enjoy the tasks involved in creating a web application, creating front end for the application, creating the back end for the application, designing and creating REST APIs to connect the back end and front end, and designing and modelling database models to store the website data.

In 2019, I successfully completed a **Angular/Django full stack Moringa Core Program** which greatly helped me develop imagination and creativity. Throughout this program we studied **JavaScript/TypeScript/Angular** front end development and **Python/Flask/Django** back end development. 

We also covered concepts such as software design patterns. Here we were taught two patterns which are **MVT(Model View Template)**, and **MVC(Model View Controller)**.

Outside Activities/Hobbies - outside of college and coding I really enjoy playing video games.

I also enjoy listening to music especially Reggae and Soul.
