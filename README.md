### Hi. I'm Karangu Lucas, nice to meet you. Please take a look around!

Iâ€™m a Kenyan based Angular Django, & Flask full-stack web developer focused on crafting and developing maintainable enterprise class Angular, Django & Flask applictaions using the Django, Angular & Flask coding style model. For personal projects, I have created several apps that run perfectly on web browsers and any mobile devices using upcoming technologies such as [Progressive Web Apps](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) which focus on intuitive user interface and rich user experience.

Below you can see some projects. I've been working on lately:

* [Bookmarks](https://github.com/lwairore/bookmarks). Social application that allows users to log in, log out, edit, reset their password, bookmark and share images they find on other sites, and follow each other.


**Current Focus**: [Angular](https://angular.io/) // [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) // [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)


#### OK, LET'S CREATE SOMETHING GREAT
